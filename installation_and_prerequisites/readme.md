# Before getting started

### Installations

Before you get started with this Python bootcamp, there are a couple of softwares you will very likely find useful. Please make sure they are installed before the first lesson so that we can be on the same pace. Let me know if you encounter any problem.

##### Git bash (optional)
1. For Windows users please use [this link](https://gitforwindows.org/).
2. For Mac users please visit [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

_Remark_: the simplest way is just to google "git bash".

##### Anaconda (highly recommended)
Anaconda is available in its [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). You can use either Python 2 or Python 3 (in fact you can have them both in your system! We will cover this later on in more advanced topics). But the lesson will be using Python 3 so it is recommended to download Python 3.7 for this bootcamp.

_Remark_: keep the default settings for your convenience.

### Sign-ups
##### GitHub.com (optional)
Get yourself a GitHub account by visiting [this link](https://github.com/join).

##### Skype
We will be using Skype to host our lessons. You can download it from [here](https://www.skype.com/en/) and make sure you get yourself an account. Please add me as your friend! I can be found with my Skype ID `live:538c42a2d33d2748`. (I know it is a pain to type in such long string! Sorry but it is a bad idea to publish my phone number online.) Please do let me know if you are unable to find me so that I can add you back :).

_Remark_: if the Skype connection is poor, we will try other conference apps. Will be great if you can let me be aware of any connection issue you have before we start!

See you in our upcoming lessons!

##### Repl.it
A simple online IDE supporting multiple programming languages. For coding exercises you will find it useful - drag and drop the folder and run the whole script without using shells. Link is [here](https://repl.it/).
