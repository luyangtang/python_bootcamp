# What is Python
Python is a **very-high-level** **programming** language.


### Advantages of using Python
1. Python is an **interpreted** language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.

2. Time-saving:
  - the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
  - statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
  - no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

_Remark_: Python is named after the BBC show Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus, not the reptile!!

### Unix shell
What is Unix shell?
- A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

### Command line and environment
- [Reading material is here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-general).

### Interactive mode
In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>);
Here you can do line-by-line sequential execution.
